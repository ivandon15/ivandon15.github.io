# About

> Building bridges between computational intelligence and molecular design.

ðŸ‘‹ Hi â€” I'm Ivan. I'm an algorithm engineer with a keen interest in life sciences, particularly pharmaceuticals. I currently have three years of experience working in AI-assisted cyclic peptide drug design. 

If you're interested in AIDD, or if you're an experimentalist with a need for an AI model (such as AF3 or RFDiffusion), please contact me to discuss.
